# Sunodo CLI

Sunodo provides a CLI to help developers to:

-   `create` applications from templates
-   `build` applications from source to a cartesi machine
-   `run` applications in a local development environment
-   `test` applications running inside a cartesi machine
-   `deploy` applications to a cloud provider
-   `monitor` application already running on a cloud provider

It's implemented using the [oclif framework](https://oclif.io) and distributed through several channels including `npm` and `homebrew`.
