# Sunodo

![Release Packages](https://github.com/sunodo/sunodo/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)

Sunodo is a framework for developing decentralized applications built on top of [Cartesi](http://cartesi.io) technology.
It helps developers to:

-   `create` applications from templates
-   `build` applications from source to a Cartesi machine
-   `run` applications in a local development environment
-   `test` applications running inside a Cartesi machine
-   `deploy` applications to a cloud provider
-   `monitor` application already running on a cloud provider
-   `doctor` verify the minimal requirements for the Sunodo CLI commands
-   `hash` prints out Cartesi Machine templateHash generated by the build command
